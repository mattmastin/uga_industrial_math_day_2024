---

# Getting Jobs / Lessons

# Mailchimp (Email Marketing)
  - connection through a former UGA student (John Foreman)
    - you're already networking
  - junior engineering on the data science team
    - I knew how to code, but had to learn how software is actually built

---

# Getting Jobs / Lessons

# Mutiny (Marketing Startup)
  - connection through a former coworker at Mailchimp
  - hired to build out machine learning function
  - got laid off
    - lesson: understand how your work impacts the business
      - consider asking question about this during interviews
      - industry dependent, marketing is hard to measure

---
# Job Hunt

- Took about 3 months to find a new job.
- Any tips for weathering the stressful job search process? 
  - Interviewing is a skill and it's hard to practice
  - Focus on learning something each time.

- LinkedIn was more useful than I expected.

- Seemed like the "data science" roles fell into two buckets:
  1. Analysis and experimentation to make business decisions
  2. Building machine learning systems

---

# Getting Jobs / Lessons

# Next Insurance
  - Decided to lean into engineering
  - Found this position through a former coworker
  - "full-stack" data science team

- How did you find the ad for the job you eventually got? 
  - I've never gotten a job by via an ad or posting
  - Every role I've gotten has been through networking

# Other Questions

### How would you list and rank what employers look for in candidates for your role in the current job market?
- buzz word time: **stakeholder management**
  - describing work/capabilities/timelines/dependencies in an understandable way
    - academia is probably the best source of these skills
    - managing competing priorities 
- technical ability
  - maybe modeling
  - maybe coding

---
# Other Questions

### Any tips on how to frame pure math skills on your resume/ other resume tips?  

- "Alien Teleportation"
  - making connections between things that others miss
  - Math has the advantage in helping with this skill over other fields
    - understanding over technique
    - abstraction over complexity

---
# Other Questions

## What resources would you recommend for interview preparation?
  - Learn about the business ahead of time
  - If it's a role that involves coding, you should be prepared to do live coding or provide code samples
  - start a github account and use it for something
    - maybe a simple website (google "static website)
    - tinker with git / github / gitlab / vscode


---
# Other Questions


- What does a typical workday in your life look like? How many hours do you devote to work? 
  - I probably work more than 40 hours a week, but usually because I can't get a problem out of my head... a habit from academia for sure


- Do you need to devote additional time outside your work to upskill for growth and/or maintain your role? 
  - I don't do a lot of this, but I've prioritized being able to do this as part of my role

---

# Other Questions

- What non-math course(s) do you wish you had taken?
  - Experimental design from somewhere?
  - Software Engineering
  - Statistics, or at least attend talks to learn the words

- Would you advise your undergrad self to get an additional major or degree? If so, what? 
  - I did most of a computer science bachelors.
    - What I learned has been invaluable.
    - It's never come up that I don't have the degree.

---
# Other Questions

- Do certifications/bootcamps work? If so, what should one keep in mind when selecting which one?
  - I think value would be in what you learn, not having a certificate.

- Any tips on how to expand your network to people in the industry?
  - Keep track of people you've met here
  - Cold start problem

### Would you be open to students reaching out to you? How would you like them to contact you? (LinkedIn/Email/Something else) 

Absolutely, email or LinkedIn are probably best:

# Technical Topics

# LLMs are more than chatbots


- All Businesses in the US (ALBUS)
  - Aggregate business info from the web to provide data for risk modeling

- "the relevance problem"
  - Given a business, how do we know if a particular piece of data is associated to that business or some other similar one?

# Technical Topics

# LLMs are more than chatbots

- AlbusGPT
  - LLMs are very good at simple "reasoning" problems like this
  - Much more effective to use them in solving the relevance problem than the previous, more intricate, methods
